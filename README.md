# DevTask

DevTask is an ASP.NET MVC Web Application, it gives a user the ability to CRUD an account, pull down real information about a GitHub repo through GitHub's API, and add/edit tasks to a repo of their choice. 

### Project Context
* Number of primary contributors: **1**
* Total work-time: **55 Hours**

### Continued Development
* The feature to Log In with Google is a work in progress. The form is generated but it throws an exception if an attempt is made to use it. (In the deployed version of the app, the form doesn't generate at all)
* When a task is created, an issue will be made in GitHub for that repo.
* More CSS and styling is being worked on.
